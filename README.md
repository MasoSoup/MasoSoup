- 👋 Hi, I’m @MasoSoup aka Mason
- 👀 I’m interested in so many different things, I truly enjoy learning. The possibilties within tech are endless and that excites me, I have not been this excited to get out there and accomplish something in a very long time so coding, and development are filling a part of me that I did not know I was missing! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on tbd
- 📫 How to reach me Email: masonthompson.dev@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a huge soccer fan, soccer is definitely one of the few things that take up most of my free time wether that is playing or watching. I am also a concert goer (this also takes up a big part of my free time) I love the music scene and the atmosphere that surrounds concerts and festivals every moment I can be listening to music I am! I also enjoy cooking as well as just eating food in general, I will try just about anything atleast once.
